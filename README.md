# 🎼ToneScribe 

**ToneScribe** is a web app built with **React.js** that uses **AI and natural language processing (NLP)** to analyze the tone of written text. Whether you're writing an email, a message, or creative content, ToneScribe helps you understand the emotional or stylistic tone behind your words — from formal and respectful to condescending and sarcastic.

This project was created by a college software engineering student to explore the intersection of front-end development, user experience, and AI-enhanced language tools.

## 📚 Why I Made This

As a college student studying software engineer, I wanted a project that went beyond the “to-do lists” and showed how tools like AI can improve everyday tasks. As I draft emails and work on countless papers, I often wonder if my writing accurately conveys my intended tone. This is where ToneScribe comes in — it’s built to analyze a piece of text, interpret the writer's tone, and provide users with assistance on how to improve their communication.
